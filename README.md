# Surveyor

Surveyor is a Python utility that queries Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
products and summarizes the results. Security and IT teams can use Surveyor to
baseline their environments and identify abnormal activity.

## Analyze your endpoints

Surveyor uses both definition files and pre-built queries to run searches across
an environment and provide insights into what applications or activities exist
within an enterprise, who is using them, and how. EDR user interfaces and REST
APIs provide direct access to events and processes and are useful for
real-time threat detection, digital forensics, and incident response, to name a
few use cases.

Surveyor currently supports the following EDR platforms:

- Carbon BlackÂ® (Cb) Enterprise Response
- VMware Carbon Black Cloud Enterprise EDR (formerly Carbon Black ThreatHunter)
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
